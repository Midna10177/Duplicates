hello,
 arguments for duplicates.py are as follows:
   duplicates.py arg1 arg2 arg3
    arg1,arg2, and arg3 are all concatenated as the same file name, so be sure that your only operand is your file path, spaces are okay.

 arguments for "convert duplicates to symlinks.py" are as follows:
  "convert duplicates to symlinks.py" arg1, arg2, arg3
    arg1,arg2,arg3: Path to "duplicatefilespyPickleObject" file, similarly, all args are concatenated to one argument,
